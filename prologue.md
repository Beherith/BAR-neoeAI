## prologue 

`springrts` is an open source RTS game engine. 

I am interested in writing some AI for games.

reason has two, 1. I like programming and gaming. 2. I do not play rts good.

talking about AI, there are mainly 2 kinds, 

1. logic type 

based on some rules, heuristic search. mainly you write your knowledge about how to play into computer source code. teach program how to play, and let it play for you. and some tricks, some computing, which you may be do in real game play, which human brain computes so slow. only intuition goes fast. but it's hard to write down your intuition or flair into source code.


2. neural network  

try to simulting the brain's neural network. I'm not in it, sometime against it. even you write an AI powerful by it. you maybe have no idea why and how in the detail. they has no souls! things get done, like face recognition, voice recognition, automative driving, big data discovery. quite amazing. very useful sometime, but also dangerous, someday if AI begin to against human and killing all human, it's also no way to find out why, no way to debug or tweak.

so back to the thread, i will use logic one. but logic AI also has it's shortcoming, it's trival to write. and, the rules if they don't involve by themselves, a couter can be found out. then become limitless game of spear vs shield.

There are games like starcraft and DOTA. AI's are written for them. because they are played by millions of people, if AI beat human, goes big news, so big company like Google related AlphaZero and Musk related OpenAI are like to work on it.

But if you played open source ones like springrts, then SC2 or DOAT2 are trash for AI. I'm sure about it. 

BAR is a derived branch of springrts. it has rich kind of units, and modern graphics. it can be compared to SC2. while open sourced.

I see hobby AI for SC2 and DOTA2, they can come to BAR, it's ideal platform to work with.

Because the nature of open source. If you run into a problem you can track down to the detail line of code. It has nothing unclear if you have the time to investigate. Even more,
you can change what ever thing to fit into your needs. also sounds like a wonderful playground for just programming hobbist like me. even don't write some power AI at all. Just the same reason I like Linux.
